## My process
- I coded this design challenge with the aid of Bootstrap as my CSS framework.
- Created the mobile version of the header section first, followed by creating the desktop version of the header section. Also did the same thing for the main section mobile first before desktop and the footer section.
- i created two style sheet on for mobile and the other for desktop. it made my job easier for me creating diff stylesheet and linking both up in the head section of the HTML doc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap



### What I learned

- This challenge took me a while to figure out.
  I started by using bootstrap, designed the desktop view with all confidence went to design the mobile version. this was where i had serious issues bcos thing where getting displaced in the desktop version while trying to design the mobile version and it was really fustrating.
- So what i learnt and figured out was creating the mobile workflow first before the desktop section by section to figure out which element where getting displaced and was able to counter it immediately.

 code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css 
 mobile version design for box1 this snippet was used
.box1 {
        display: block;
}
desktop version
.box1 {
       display: flex;
}
```



### Continued development

My continued development will be understanding Bootsrap better and always doing mobile workflow first section by section before designing desktop.
